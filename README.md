# BOCIL Study

### About
Bocil Study is a web-based project originally created by JSON Team (Lefry, Natalio, and Regina) to participate on Liga Coding by Skilvul. It was originally created without using any frameworks due to lack of knowledge back then. At the time it was submitted, it was a semi-finished project. Therefore, we are planning to redesign it into a fully finished and good looking website.

### Website
The website can be seen [here](https://bocil-study.netlify.app/) it was deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
