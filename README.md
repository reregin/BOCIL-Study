# BOCIL Study

### About
Bocil Study is a web-based project originally created by JSON Team (Lefry, Natalio, and Regina) to participate on Liga Coding by Skilvul. At the time it was submitted, it was a semi-finished project. Therefore, I (Regina) am planning to redesign it into a fully finished and good looking website.

### Website
The website can be seen [here](https://bocil-study.netlify.app/) it was deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
